    <h1>NeXT</h1>
    <p>Most associate Jobs’ success with Apple. However, in the early days, Jobs' relationship with Apple proved to be a rocky one. After being fired from the company he founded in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT, a firm that created computers for business and educational
        needs. While NeXT wasn't particularly successful based on units sold, the company continues to be an integral part of computers today. Portions of Nextstep operating systems still live on within Mac OSX. Additionally, the famous “Wolfenstein”
        and “Doom” computer games were written on NeXTcube stations.</p>
