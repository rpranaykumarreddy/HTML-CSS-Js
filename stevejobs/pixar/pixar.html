    <h1>Pixar</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Jobs' $5 million acquisition of Lucasfilms' Computer Graphic Division in 1986 proved to be a wise investment. The potential he saw in the company—later renamed Pixar—paid off when he sold it to Disney (DIS) in 2006 for $7.4 billion. Prior to the mid-1990s,
        Disney was the gold standard of full-length animated feature films, and it wasn’t until the success of Toy Story in 1995 that Pixar landed on the map. With each subsequent film, Pixar gained steam and created a whole animation industry in Hollywood.
        The company’s movies grossed around $3.5 billion worldwide before its acquisition by Disney.</p>
    <br>
    <p>While Jobs lacked expertise in graphic design and video production, he believed Pixar’s computer technology and animation would one day match Disney’s work. Job’s biggest impact was on the strategic direction of the company, including leading and
        overseeing Pixar’s initial public offering (IPO) in 1995. The investment capital Pixar received from going public gave Jobs the freedom to rapidly expand the company. Many attest that Jobs' drive and vision for Pixar gave the company the support
        it needed to prosper and flourish. Today Pixar is recognized as one of the most influential film studios in the world.</p>
